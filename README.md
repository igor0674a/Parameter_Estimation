Description

This repository demonstrates how repeated random sampling converges to true population parameters, using the Customer_Age variable from Kaggle’s Predicting Credit Card Customer Attrition dataset. The Jupyter Notebook calculates the population mean and standard deviation, then repeatedly draws bootstrap samples of fixed size. For each set of samples, it computes sample means and standard deviations, compares them to the population values, and visualizes the differences as the number of samples increases. The resulting plots clearly illustrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in practice—showing how randomness stabilizes into reliable estimates with enough repetitions.# Parameter_Estimation
